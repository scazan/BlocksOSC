  "body": "# BlocksOSC\r\nA program to transmit OSC data directly from the ROLI Lightpad Block.\r\nBy default, it also turns off the LEDs and only uses them to show touch data while performing.\r\n\r\n###[Download for Linux](http://scottcazan.com/img/BlocksOSC-Linux.zip)\r\nMac OSX download coming soon<br>\r\nWindows not available (just need someone with a Windows machine to run the compiler)\r\n\r\nCurrently transmits OSC messages to localhost, port 57120 with the following messages:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/block/lightpad/0/on - (fingerIndex, x, y, z)\r\n/block/lightpad/0/off - (fingerIndex)\r\n/block/lightpad/0/position - (fingerIndex, x, y, z)\r\n/block/lightpad/0/button - (1)\r\n```\r\nVery early in development. Support for multiple-modes and addressing the LEDs over OSC is planned.\r\n",
