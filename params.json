  "body": "# BlocksOSC\r\nA program to transmit OSC data directly from the ROLI Lightpad Block.\r\nBy default, it also turns off the LEDs and only uses them to show touch data while performing.\r\n\r\nCurrently transmits OSC messages to localhost, port 57120 with the following messages:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/block/lightpad/0/on - (fingerIndex, x, y, z)\r\n/block/lightpad/0/off - (fingerIndex)\r\n/block/lightpad/0/position - (fingerIndex, x, y, z)\r\n/block/lightpad/0/button - (1)\r\n```\r\nVery early in development. Support for multiple-modes and addressing the LEDs over OSC is planned.\r\n",
